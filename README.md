User-Friendly Input Forms: Intuitive form for journey details input, including source, destination, and stops.
Geocoding and Mapping with HERE API: Geocoding responses, using HERE API to pinpoint locations on the map.
Route Creation with Polylines: Plotting routes through marked locations using encoded polylines.
Dynamic Detour Calculation: Advanced detour visualization dynamically assessing distances from source to destination, including user-added stops.

Utilization of HERE APIs (Maps, Geocoding, Multi-Modal, Detouring distance calculation, Polyline).
Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend powered by Flask framework.
Integration of ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo from OpenAI for chatbot functionality.

AsWeGo is a user-friendly website powered by HERE Services, offering guided tours, historical insights, and interactive maps for tourists exploring a city.   

This chatbot enables users to interact naturally with the map, asking questions, seeking recommendations, and receiving real-time information about nearby attractions.  

Additionally, the chatbot provides transportation suggestions, streamlining the journey for users and ensuring they make the most of their time in the city. Also, accounting for any detours that might occur during the journey.
