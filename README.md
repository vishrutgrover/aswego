MapMyWorld is a user-friendly website powered by HERE Services, offering guided tours, historical insights, and interactive maps for tourists exploring a city.   

This chatbot enables users to interact naturally with the map, asking questions, seeking recommendations, and receiving real-time information about nearby attractions.  

Additionally, the chatbot provides transportation suggestions, streamlining the journey for users and ensuring they make the most of their time in the city. Also, accounting for any detours that might occur during the journey.

Our innovative approach includes the integration of a Language Learning Model (LLM) chatbot directly into the map interface such that we can directly interact with the map using the chatbot.
